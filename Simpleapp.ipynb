Purpose: To provide a framework of rules/regulations/standards/practices  to the credit, debit, prepaid card issuing banks and to the credit card  issuing NBFCs to ensure that the same are in alignment with the best customer  practices. Banks should adopt adequate safeguards and implement the  following guidelines in order to ensure that their card operations are run on  sound, prudent and customer friendly manner.\\n B. Classification: A statutory guideline issued by the RBI.\\n C. Previous Guidelines Consolidated: This  Master Circular consolidates the instructions contained in the circulars listed  in the Appendix.\\n D. Scope of Application: To all Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs) that  engage in credit, debit, pre-paid card business directly or through  their subsidiaries or affiliated companies controlled by them and to all NBFCs that  engage in credit card business. \\nI. Credit  Card Operations of Banks\\n1. Introduction  \\n This  circular is aimed at providing general guidance to banks/NBFCs on their credit  card operations, and the systems and controls expected of them in managing their  credit card business. It also sets out the best practices that they should aim  to achieve.\\n Experience  has shown that the quality of banks’ credit card portfolios mirrors the  economic environment in which they operate, and there is a strong correlation  between an economic downturn and deterioration in the quality of such portfolios.  The deterioration may become even more serious if banks have relaxed their credit  underwriting criteria and risk management standards as a result of intense competition  in the market. It is therefore important for banks to maintain prudent policies  and practices for managing the risks of their credit card business which are relevant to the market  environment that they operate in.\\n2. Issue of cards\\n 2.1 Banks in India can  undertake credit card business either departmentally or through a subsidiary company set up for the purpose. They can  also undertake domestic credit card  business by entering into tie-up arrangement with one of the banks already  having arrangements for issue of credit cards.\\n 2.2 Prior  approval of the Reserve Bank is not necessary for banks desirous of undertaking  credit card business either independently or in tie-up arrangement with  other card issuing banks. Banks can do so with the approval of  their Boards. However, only banks with networth of `100 crore and above should undertake credit card  business. Banks desirous of setting up separate subsidiaries for  undertaking credit card business would, however, require  prior approval of the Reserve Bank. \\n 2.3 Each  bank must have a well documented policy and a Fair Practices Code for credit card  operations. The Fair Practices Code should incorporate the various guidelines  on the subject issued by RBI from time to time, as well as the relevant  Guidelines contained in this Master Circular. Banks which have adopted the “Code  of Bank’s Commitment to Customers”(Code) of The Banking Codes  and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) may also incorporate the principles  enunciated therein, as amended from time to time, in their Fair Practices Code.  The Fair Practices Code should be available on the website of the Bank/NBFC. \\n 2.4 Banks/NBFCs  should ensure prudence while issuing credit cards and independently assess the credit risk  while issuing cards to persons, especially to students and others with no independent financial means. \\n 2.5 In terms of the instructions  contained in the circular  DBOD.No.Leg.BC.65/09.07.005/2006-07 dated March 6, 2007, banks have been advised  that in case of all categories of loans irrespective of any threshold limits, including  credit card applications, banks should convey in writing the main reason/reasons which in the  opinion of the bank have led to the rejection of the loan applications. It is reiterated that banks should  convey in writing the main reason/reasons which have led to the  rejection of the credit card applications.\\n 2.6 As  holding several credit cards enhances the total credit available to any  consumer, banks/NBFCs  should assess the credit limit for a credit card customer having regard to the limits enjoyed by the cardholder from other  banks on the basis of self- declaration/ credit information obtained  from a CIC.\\n 2.7 While issuing cards, the  terms and conditions for issue and usage of a credit card should be mentioned in clear and simple language  (preferably in English, Hindi and the local  language) comprehensible to a card user. The Most Important Terms and Conditions  (MITCs) termed as standard set of conditions, as given in the Annex, should be highlighted and advertised/sent separately to the prospective  customer/customers at all the stages  i.e. during marketing, at the time of application, at the acceptance stage  (welcome kit) and in important subsequent communications.\\n 2.8 In  cases where the banks are offering any insurance cover to  their credit card holders, in tie-up with insurance companies, the banks  may consider obtaining in writing from the credit card holders the details of  nominee/s for the insurance cover in respect of accidental death  and disablement benefits. Banks may ensure that the relevant nomination  details are recorded by the Insurance Company. Banks may also consider issuing  a letter to the credit card holder indicating the details regarding the name, address  and telephone number of the Insurance Company which will handle the claims relating to the insurance  cover.\\n3. Types of credit cards\\n 3.1 Banks  may issue credit cards including co-branded credit cards, corporate  credit cards to the employees of their corporate customers, as well as add-on credit  cards.\\n 3.2  However, while issuing co-branded credit cards, banks must  undertake due diligence on the non-bank entity to protect themselves  against the reputation risk to which they are exposed to in such an arrangement.  NBFCs, which desire to enter into a co-branding arrangement for issue of  credit cards with banks, may be guided by the instructions contained in circular  No. DNBS (PD) CC No.83/03.10.27/2006-07 dated  December 04, 2006\\n        3.3 Add-on  cards i.e. those that are subsidiary to the principal card,  may be issued with the clear understanding that the liability will be that of the principal  cardholder. Similarly while issuing corporate credit cards, the  responsibilities and liabilities of the corporate and its employees may be  clearly specified.\\n4. Compliance  with Know  Your Customer (KYC) Norms/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Standards/Combating of  Financing of Terrorism (CFT)/Obligation of Banks under PMLA, 2002 \\n The  instructions/guidelines on KYC/AML/CFT applicable to banks, issued by RBI from  time to time, may be adhered to  in respect of all cards issued, including co-branded, corporate, and add  on credit cards. \\n 5. Interest rates and other charges\\n 5.1 Banks  are advised to be guided by the instructions on interest rate on advances  issued by RBI and as  amended from time to time, while determining the interest rate on credit card dues,  the latter being in the nature of non-priority sector personal loans. Banks should also prescribe a ceiling rate of interest,  including processing and other charges, in respect of credit cards. In  case banks/NBFCs charge interest  rates which vary based on the payment/default history of the cardholder, there should  be transparency in levying of such differential interest rates. In other words,  the fact that higher interest rates are being  charged to the cardholder on account of his payment/default history should be made known to the cardholder. For this  purpose, the banks should publicise through their website and other  means, the interest rates charged to various  categories of customers. Banks/NBFCs should upfront indicate to the  credit card holder, the methodology of calculation of finance charges with  illustrative examples, particularly in  situations where a part of the amount outstanding is only paid by the  customer.\\n 5.2 Further,  the banks/NBFCs have to adhere to the following guidelines relating to interest  rates and  other charges on credit cards:\\n\\n\\nCard issuers should ensure that there is no delay in  dispatching bills and the customer has sufficient number of days (at least one  fortnight) for making payment before the interest starts getting charged. In order to  obviate frequent complaints of delayed billing, the credit card issuing  bank/NBFC may consider providing bills and statements of  accounts online, with suitable security measures. Banks/NBFCs could also consider putting  in place a mechanism to ensure that the customer’s acknowledgement is obtained  for receipt of the monthly statement.\\n\\n\\nCard  issuers should quote Annualized Percentage Rates (APR) on card products (separately for retail purchase and for cash  advance, if different). The method of calculation  of APR should be given with a couple of examples for better comprehension. The APR charged and the annual fee  should be shown with equal prominence.  The late payment charges, including the method of calculation of such charges and the number of days, should be  prominently indicated. The manner in which  the outstanding unpaid amount will be included for calculation of interest  should also be specifically shown  with prominence in all monthly statements. Even where the minimum amount indicated to keep the card valid  has been paid, it should be indicated in  bold letters that the interest will be charged on the amount due after the due  date of payment. These aspects may be  shown in the Welcome Kit in addition to being shown in the monthly statement. A legend/notice to the effect that “Making only the minimum payment every month would result in the repayment  stretching over years with \\r\\n            consequent interest payment on your outstanding  balance\" should be prominently displayed in all the monthly statements so as to caution  the customers about the pitfalls in paying only the minimum amount due.\\n\\n\\nBanks/NBFCs should step up their efforts on educating the  cardholders of the implications of paying only ‘the minimum amount due’.  The “Most Important Terms and Conditions” should specifically explain that the ‘free  credit period’ is lost if any balance of the previous month’s bill is outstanding. For this  purpose, banks/NBFCs could work out illustrative  examples and include the same in the Welcome Kit sent to the cardholders  as also place it on their website.\\n\\n\\nBanks  are advised to follow uniform method of determining over-due status for credit  card accounts while reporting to credit information companies and for the  purpose of levying penal charges viz., late payment charges, etc., if any, as  issued in terms of our circular  DBOD.No.BP.BC.78/21.04.048/2013-14 dated December 20, 2013, as amended from  time to time.\\n\\n\\nThe banks/NBFCs should not levy any charge that was not  explicitly indicated to the credit card holder at the time of issue of the card and  without getting his/her consent. However, this would not be  applicable to charges like service taxes, etc. which may subsequently be levied by  the Government or any other statutory authority.\\n\\n\\nThe  terms and conditions for payment of credit card dues, including the minimum payment due, should be stipulated so as to ensure  that there is no negative amortization.\\n\\n\\nChanges in charges (other than interest) may be made only  with prospective effect giving notice of at least one month. If a credit card  holder desires to surrender his credit card on account of any change in credit  card charges to his disadvantage, he may be permitted to do  so without the bank levying any extra charge for such closure. Any request  for closure of a credit card has to be honoured immediately by the credit card issuer, subject to  full settlement of dues by the cardholder.\\n\\n\\nThere should be transparency (without any hidden charges)  in issuing credit cards free  of charge during the first year.\\n\\n\\n6. Wrongful billing \\n The  card issuing bank/NBFC should ensure that wrong bills are not raised and issued  to customers. In case, a customer protests any bill, the bank/ NBFC  should provide explanation and, if necessary, documentary evidence may  also be provided to the customer within  a maximum  period of sixty days with a spirit to amicably redress the grievances.\\n7.  Use of Direct Sales Agent (DSAs)/Direct Marketing Agents (DMAs) and other Agents\\n 7.1. When banks/NBFCs outsource the various  credit card operations, they have to be extremely careful that the appointment  of such service providers does not compromise with  the quality of the customer service and the banks\\'/NBFCs\\' ability to manage  credit, liquidity and operational  risks. In the choice of the service provider, the banks/NBFCs have to be guided by the need to ensure  confidentiality of the customer’s records, respect customer privacy, and  adhere to fair practices in debt collection.\\n 7.2 In terms of the BCSBI’s Code of Bank’s  Commitment to Customers, banks which have subscribed to the Code are  required to prescribe a Code of Conduct for their DSAs whose  services are engaged by banks for marketing their products/services. Banks should ensure  that the DSAs engaged by them for marketing their  credit card products scrupulously adhere to the Code of Conduct for Credit Card operations of the banks/NBFCs which should be displayed on the website of individual bank/NBFC and  be available easily to any credit card holder.\\n7.3 The bank/NBFC should have a system of random checks and  mystery shopping to ensure  that their agents have been properly briefed and trained in order to handle  with care and caution their  responsibilities, particularly in the aspects included in these guidelines like soliciting customers, hours for  calling, privacy of customer information, conveying the correct terms  and conditions of the product on offer, etc.\\n7.4 Banks  may ensure that they engage telemarketers who comply with  directions/regulations on the subject issued by the Telecom Regulatory  Authority of India (TRAI) from time to time while adhering to  guidelines issued on “Unsolicited  Commercial Communications – National Customer Preference Register (NCPR)”.\\n 8. Issue of  unsolicited cards/facilities \\n 8.1 Unsolicited cards should not be issued. In  case, an unsolicited card is issued and activated  without the written consent of the recipient and the latter is billed for the same, the card issuing bank shall not only reverse  the charges forthwith, but also pay a penalty  without demur to the recipient amounting to twice the value of the charges reversed.\\n8.2 In addition, the person in whose name the card is issued  can also approach the Banking Ombudsman who would determine the amount of  compensation payable by the bank to the recipient of the unsolicited card as per  the provisions of the Banking Ombudsman Scheme 2006, i.e., for loss of complainant’s  time, expenses incurred, harassment  and mental anguish suffered by him.\\n8.3 There have been instances where unsolicited cards issued  have been misused before reaching the person in whose name these have been  issued. It is clarified that any loss arising out of misuse of such unsolicited cards  will be the responsibility of the card issuing bank/NBFC only and the  person in whose name the card has been issued cannot be held responsible for the  same.\\n8.4 The consent for the cards issued or the other products  offered along with the card has to be explicit and should not be implied. In other  words, the written consent of the applicant would be required before issuing a credit card.\\n8.5 Unsolicited loans or other credit facilities should not  be offered to the credit card customers. In case an unsolicited credit facility is  extended without the consent of the recipient and the latter objects to the same, the credit  sanctioning bank/NBFC shall not only  withdraw the credit limit, but also be liable to pay such penalty as may be considered  appropriate.\\n8.6 The card issuing bank/NBFC should not  unilaterally upgrade credit cards and enhance credit limits. Prior consent  of the borrower should invariably be taken whenever there are any change/s in  terms and conditions.\\n9. Customer confidentiality\\n9.1 The card issuing bank/NBFC should not reveal any  information relating to customers obtained at the time of opening the  account or issuing the credit card to any other person or  organization without obtaining their specific consent, as regards the purpose/s  for which the information will be used and the organizations with whom the information  will be shared. The application form for credit card must  explicitly provide for consent the same.  Further, in case where the customers gives his consent for the bank sharing  the information with other agencies, banks should explicitly state and explain clearly to the customer the full meaning/  implications of the disclosure clause. The  information being sought from customers  should not be of such nature as will violate the provisions of the laws relating to secrecy in the transactions.  Banks/NBFCs would be solely responsible for the correctness or otherwise  of the data provided for the purpose.\\n9.2 The disclosure to the DSAs/recovery agents should also be  limited to the extent that will enable them to discharge their duties. Personal  information provided by the card holder but not required for recovery purposes  should not be released by the card issuing bank/NBFC. The card issuing  bank/NBFCs should ensure that the DSAs/DMAs do not  transfer or misuse any customer information during marketing of credit card products.\\n10. Reporting to Credit Information Companies  (CICs)\\n 10.1 For  providing information relating to credit history/repayment record of the card  holder to a Credit Information Company (that has obtained Certificate of  Registration from RBI), the bank/NBFC may explicitly bring to the notice of the  customer that such information is being provided in terms of the Credit Information  Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005.\\n 10.2 Before  reporting default status of a credit card holder to a Credit Information Company  which has obtained Certificate of Registration from RBI and of which the  bank/NBFC is a member, banks/NBFCs should ensure that they adhere to a  procedure, duly approved by their Board, including issuing of sufficient notice to  such card holder about the intention to report him/ her as defaulter to  the Credit Information Company. The procedure should also cover  the notice period for such reporting as also the period within which such  report will be withdrawn in the event the customer settles his dues after  having been  reported as defaulter. Banks/NBFCs should be particularly careful in the case  of cards where there are pending disputes.  The disclosure/release of information, particularly  about the default, should be made only after the dispute is settled as far as possible. In all cases, a well laid down procedure  should be transparently followed. These procedures should also be  transparently made known as part of MITCs.\\n11. Fair practices in debt collection\\n 11.1 In  the matter of recovery of dues, banks should ensure that they, as also their agents,  adhere to the extant instructions on Fair Practice Code for lenders (as also  BCSBI’s Code of Bank’s Commitment to Customers (those banks which  have subscribed to the BCSBI Code). In case banks have their own code for collection  of dues, they should, at the minimum,  incorporate all the terms of BCSBI’s Code referred above.\\n 11.2 In particular, in regard to appointment of  third party agencies for debt collection, it is essential that  such agents refrain from action that could damage the integrity and reputation  of the bank/NBFC and that they observe strict customer confidentiality. All letters  issued by recovery agents must contain the name and address of a responsible senior officer of the card  issuing bank whom the customer can contact at his location.\\n 11.3 Banks/NBFCs/their agents should not resort to  intimidation or harassment of any kind,  either verbal or physical, against any person in their debt collection efforts,  including acts intended to humiliate  publicly or intrude the privacy of the credit card holders’ family members, referees and friends,  making threatening and anonymous calls or making false and misleading  representations.\\n 11.4 The  banks should also ensure to comply with the extant guidelines in respect of engagement  of recovery agents issued by RBI, as amended from time to time. \\n12.   Redressal of grievances\\n 12.1 Generally,  a time limit of 60 (sixty) days may be given to the customers for referring their complaints/grievances.\\n 12.2 The  card issuing bank/NBFC should constitute Grievance Redressal machinery within  the bank/NBFC and give wide publicity about it through electronic and print media. The name and contact  number of designated grievance redressal officer of the bank/NBFC should be mentioned on the credit card bills. The designated  officer should ensure that genuine  grievances of credit card subscribers are redressed promptly without  involving delay.\\n 12.3 Banks/NBFCs  should ensure that their call centre staff is trained adequately to competently handle all  customer complaints.\\n 12.4 Banks/NBFCs  should also have a mechanism to escalate automatically unresolved complaints from a call  center to higher authorities and the details of such mechanism should be put in  public domain through their website.\\n 12.5 The  grievance redressal procedure of the bank/NBFC and the time frame fixed for responding  to the complaints should be placed on the bank\\'s website. The name, designation,  address and contact number of important executives as well as the Grievance  Redressal Officer of the bank/NBFC may be displayed on the website. There  should be a system of acknowledging customers\\' complaints for follow up, such as complaint number/docket  number, even if the complaints are received on phone.\\n 12.6 If  a complainant does not get satisfactory response from the bank/NBFC which is a subsidiary  of a bank within a maximum period of thirty (30) days from the date of his lodging  the complaint, he will have the option to approach the Office of the concerned Banking  Ombudsman for redressal of his grievance/s. The bank/NBFC, which is a subsidiary  of a bank, shall be liable to compensate the complainant for the loss of his time,  expenses, financial loss as well as for the harassment and mental anguish suffered  by him for the fault of the bank and where the grievance has not been redressed in time.\\n13.  Internal control and monitoring systems\\n With a view to ensuring  that the quality of customer service is ensured on an on-going basis in  banks/NBFCs, the Standing Committee on Customer Service in each bank/NBFC  should review the credit card operations including reports of defaulters  to a Credit Information Company which has obtained Certificate of  Registration from RBI and of which the bank/NBFC is a member and credit card  related complaints on a monthly basis and take measures to improve the services  and ensure the orderly growth in the credit card operations.
